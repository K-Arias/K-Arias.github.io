### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 2

    This is one of my favorite labs because it taught us how to use if else
    statements.These statements were used for a game called Hilo, where a 
    player guesses a number and the computer has to respond appropriately. 
    I enjoyed the simplicity of the lab and the game.

* Lab 6, part 1

    This is another favorite lab of mine as it introduced vectors, which 
    was a new and exciting concept for me to learn. Vectors being a part 
    of the future labs make this lab special to me. In part 1, the user has
    to input three valid descriptions for the sandwich, which the computer
    takes into a vector and outputs it into the screen. It was awesome.

* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab is another favorite of mine because I did it all on my own 
    because I could not make it class that day. Part 1 was about getting 
    the average of a group of numbers but removing the biggest and smallest
    number beforehand, this was done with one function. I liked this lab 
    because it was a new challenge for me to get the entire lab done by myself.
